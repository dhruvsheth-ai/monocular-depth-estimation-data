### Data optained from trained models by Monodepth2
**Data generated is not for commercial applications**

```shell
Note : Depth predicted in Monocular Depth estimaation model generated depth images is relative in comparision to other entities in the observed image and does not help in assesment of depth in units
```

```shell
Note: Depth images fail to be preicted from a blurred background. The model is trained on images where entities closer to the viewer are blurred than the ones that are far. Hence, keep in mind not to assess the data which is filtered
```
You can notice this in the apple4.jpeg and apple4-depth.jpeg images
